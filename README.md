# Serverless Framework Python Flask API service backed by DynamoDB on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Python Flask API service, backed by DynamoDB, running on AWS Lambda using the traditional Serverless Framework.

### Prerequisites

In order to package your dependencies locally with `serverless-python-requirements`, you need to have `Python3.8` installed locally. You can create and activate a dedicated virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```
